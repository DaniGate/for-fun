A collection of different data science projects and tools and also some Python functions and classes that I programmed for fun:

* **[POI_identifier.ipynb](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/danigate/for-fun/blob/master/POI_identifier.ipynb)**:
  A classification algorithm that predict which Enron's executive are persons of interest (POI) and should be
  further investigated for possible fraud activities. I use some public information about their contract conditions
  like salary or bonus, the list of prosecuted Enron executives as positive examples and also a few features
  extracted from the public Enron email dataset.
* **Magic Star**: an algorithm to solve a 6-points [magic star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_star) and print it
  on screen. Solutions to the 7- and 8-pointed magic stars are still under development.
* **Top words**: implementation of a simple TF-IDF analysis to extract the most common words from a text.
